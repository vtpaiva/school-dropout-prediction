# school-dropout-prediction

In this repository, a report was developed on the task of predicting school dropout rates in **Brazil**, using data mining and machine learning to address a societal issue. The problem tackled was school dropout in Brazil, aiming to structure a model that predicts dropout rates in Brazilian schools and extracts relevant attributes, highlighting the key factors impacting national education. The dataset was built by integrating the **2021** *INEP* School Census with municipal **GDP** data from *IBGE*.

The process involved exploring sampling methods and different classification algorithms, with the goal of identifying the factors that affect school dropout according to the statistical models applied.

(The code and report are written in Portuguese.)
