## Introduction

School dropout is a significant problem that affects education and the socioeconomic development of Brazil. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence school dropout is crucial to developing effective policies that can reduce its rates and improve the quality of education. Using the 2021 school census databases provided by **INEP** (National Institute for Educational Studies and Research An√≠sio Teixeira) and GDP data from municipalities provided by **IBGE** (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), the goal is to address the problem of school dropout through artificial intelligence techniques.

The objective of this study is to analyze the various factors that influence the dropout rate in all schools in Brazil, using machine learning and data mining methods. The analysis seeks to identify factors that contribute positively, negatively, or have no significant influence on school dropout. To achieve this goal, two machine learning algorithms were used: Random Forest and Neural Networks.

By using these techniques, this study intends to provide a comprehensive view of the factors influencing school dropout, offering insights for public policy formulation and educational interventions that can effectively combat this problem. The analysis and results obtained may serve as a solid foundation for future research and initiatives aimed at improving the Brazilian educational system.

## Conclusion

The study concludes that school dropout is a multi-causal problem requiring holistic approaches to address it effectively. Balanced samples proved more effective for model training, and neural networks offered better generalization compared to Random Forest.
